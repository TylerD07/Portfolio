            "In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of
            chance, my
            head is bloody but unbowed. It matters not how straight the gate, how charged with punishments the
            scroll,
            I am the master of My fate, I am the captain of my soul." <br>

            - William Earnest Henley

            My name is Tyler Daughtry and the above quote speaks volume to my life. I have had my fair share of
            short comeings and I have reveled in the joys of victories as well. I try to have a very postive out
            look
            on life and
            when Henely refers to not wincing under the misfortunes of circumstance, I beleive we shared a common
            character
            trait: Positivity. When life hits us hard we have one thing that controlls the aftermath, our reaction.
            I
            choose to trust in the fact that if I continue to strive and work hard everything will work out in my
            favor. Positivity goes a long way. A simple smile to a bystander can make their day. One good deed can
            save
            somebody from suicide. I try to be nice to everyone I encounter and spread love where ever I go. No
            matter
            how tough adversity gets I will always choose to have positve energy. By controlling my thoughts I can
            create my own reality. After all we only get one life, why waste it being mad at things that do not go
            our
            way when we can embrace the beauty of life and enjoy every second as it passes?

            Im 22 years old and I live in Atlanta, GA. I enjoy the outdoors and exploring the city on my
            skateboard.
            Family and friends are very important to me. I chose to start a career in Web Development simply
            because I
            love technology but I also want to be able to provide for my loved ones and I believe the Technology
            Field
            is the key to the future. I chose not to bore you with random facts about my life and instead I gave a
            brief look of how my brain opperates. Thoughts are powerful, so I hope my thoughts about life were of
            benefit. Now that you have an idea of how my brain works, take a look at some of my work. I gaurantee
            you
            wont be disapointed.
